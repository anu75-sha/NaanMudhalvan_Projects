# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

 #  📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a major concern for businesses, as losing customers directly impacts revenue. This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning models based on customer behavior data. By identifying at-risk customers, businesses can take proactive retention measures.

#  🚀 Tech Stack Used
#### Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
#### Machine Learning Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, etc.)
#### Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
#### Power BI (Optional) for interactive dashboards
#### Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab for development
#### SQL (Optional) for data extraction

# 📊 Dataset
#### The dataset contains customer details, transaction history, service usage, and customer feedback.
#### Features include:
#### Customer ID, Tenure, Monthly Charges, Total Charges, Contract Type
#### Payment Method, Internet Service, Support Calls, and Churn Status (Target Variable)
#### Dataset Source: You can use a dataset from Kaggle or generate synthetic data

# 📌 Project Workflow
#### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

#### Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns.
#### 2️⃣ Feature Engineering

#### Creating new features, removing highly correlated features.
####  3️⃣ Model Selection & Training

#### Train multiple ML models:
#### Logistic Regression
#### Random Forest
#### XGBoost
####Support Vector Machine (SVM)
#### Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
####  4️⃣ Model Evaluation

#### Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC Curve.
#### 5️⃣ Deployment (Optional)

#### Save the model using Pickle or Joblib.
#### Deploy using Flask or Streamlit for real-time predictions.
📈 Results & Insights
#### Key factors influencing churn (e.g., contract type, support calls, monthly charges).
#### Feature importance ranking from Random Forest / XGBoost.
#### Customer segmentation based on churn risk.
